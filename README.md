#My first Assembly
This is my first program written in assembly language


##
I recently watched a "Hello world assembly tutorial" by [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEGAaYdABA&t=600s) and that motivated me to start working with this language. :)

For now it's just two simple programs but i'll try to make more advanced things later.
